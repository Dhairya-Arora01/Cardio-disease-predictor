# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Project

![Cardiovascular Disease](https://i.imgur.com/kgu7nKj.gif)

This project is a web application that predicts the probability of cardiovascular disease based on simple features such as age, height, weight, gender, blood pressure, blood glucose level, etc. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset to make accurate predictions.

You can access the live version of this project at [168.61.20.95](http://168.61.20.95).

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

- Frontend:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Vue.js

- Backend:
  - Python Flask

- Deployment:
  - Docker (Separate Dockerfiles for backend and frontend)

- ML
  - Logistic Regression implemented using Scikit-learn

## How to Use

To use the web application, follow these steps:

1. Visit [168.61.20.95](http://168.61.20.95) in your web browser.

2. You will be presented with an intuitive user interface to enter the required input features for prediction.

3. Fill in the details such as age, height, weight, gender, blood pressure, blood glucose level, etc.

4. Click on the "Predict" button to initiate the prediction process.

5. The system will use the machine learning model to calculate the probability of cardiovascular disease based on the provided information.

6. The predicted result will be displayed on the screen along with an explanation.

## Dataset and Machine Learning Model

The dataset used to train the machine learning model can be found at [Cardio-dataset-kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset). However, you can find and use a suitable dataset to train your own model. The model should be saved and loaded by the backend to make predictions.
