## Industry
Health

## Project Title
Cardio-disease Predictor

## Project Statement/Opportunity
Predicting probability of a person having cardiovascular disease. We have deployed the application on Azure Cloud Platform. The application takes features like age, weight, bp etc. as inputs and then predicts the probability of a person to have cardiovascular disease as output.

## Project Description
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of global mortality, underscoring the importance of awareness and proactive health management. That's why we have built this application so that a person can check his probability of having cardiovascular disease and then can take appropriate actions in order to prevent it like regular exercise, healthy diet etc. We have built this web app using HTML, CSS, Vue, Flask, Docker, scikit-learn, Terraform and Azure Technologies like Linux Virutal Machines, Virtual Network (can be seen [here](https://github.com/Dhairya-Arora01/Cardio-disease-predictor/blob/bb46a482328306e785741bafff1d75e7c081deca/infra/main.tf#L21))

## Primary Azure Technologies Used
Linux Virtual Machines, Virtual Network

## Tech Stack
